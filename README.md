# Password Manager
The Password Manager is an offline app designed to securely store and manage your passwords. It provides a high level of security and allows you to have full control over your sensitive information.

## Security
To ensure the app's security, you can make adjustments in the [SecurityProcesses.cs](PasswordManager/SecurityProcesses.cs) file located in the **PasswordManager** directory. Edit this file to enhance the security measures implemented. Additionally, if you plan to use the app, modify the **GenerateKey()** function to create a secure key, and update the Salt text in the initial lines of the file.
